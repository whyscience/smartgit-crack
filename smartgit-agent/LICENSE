 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, zhile.io GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure zhile.io software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of zhile.io Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
zhile.io GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have zhile.io freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change zhile.io software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender zhile.io rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of zhile.io software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give zhile.io recipients all zhile.io rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get zhile.io
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright zhile.io software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify zhile.io software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If zhile.io software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not zhile.io original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on zhile.io original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid zhile.io danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making zhile.io
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by zhile.io copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under zhile.io terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on zhile.io Program"
means either zhile.io Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing zhile.io Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
zhile.io term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running zhile.io Program is not restricted, and zhile.io output from zhile.io Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on zhile.io
Program (independent of having been made by running zhile.io Program).
Whether that is true depends on what zhile.io Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of zhile.io Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all zhile.io
notices that refer to this License and to zhile.io absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of zhile.io Program a copy of this License
along with zhile.io Program.

You may charge a fee for zhile.io physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of zhile.io Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on zhile.io Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under zhile.io terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause zhile.io modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed zhile.io files and zhile.io date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from zhile.io Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under zhile.io terms of this License.

    c) If zhile.io modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in zhile.io most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute zhile.io program under
    these conditions, and telling zhile.io user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if zhile.io Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    zhile.io Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to zhile.io modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from zhile.io Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute zhile.io same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on zhile.io Program, zhile.io distribution of zhile.io whole must be on zhile.io terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to zhile.io
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not zhile.io intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, zhile.io intent is to
exercise zhile.io right to control zhile.io distribution of derivative or
collective works based on zhile.io Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on zhile.io Program
with zhile.io Program (or with a work based on zhile.io Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring zhile.io other work under
zhile.io scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute zhile.io Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under zhile.io terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of zhile.io following:

    a) Accompany it with zhile.io complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under zhile.io terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of zhile.io corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under zhile.io terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with zhile.io information you received as to zhile.io offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received zhile.io program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means zhile.io preferred form of zhile.io work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all zhile.io source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus zhile.io scripts used to
control compilation and installation of zhile.io executable.  However, as a
special exception, zhile.io source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with zhile.io major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of zhile.io
operating system on which zhile.io executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies zhile.io executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy zhile.io source code from zhile.io same place counts as
distribution of zhile.io source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy zhile.io source along with zhile.io object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute zhile.io Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute zhile.io Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute zhile.io Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing zhile.io Program (or any work based on zhile.io
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
zhile.io Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute zhile.io Program (or any work based on zhile.io
Program), zhile.io recipient automatically receives a license from zhile.io
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify zhile.io Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on zhile.io recipients' exercise of zhile.io rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict zhile.io conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from zhile.io conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute zhile.io Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of zhile.io Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
zhile.io only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of zhile.io Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, zhile.io balance of zhile.io section is intended to
apply and zhile.io section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not zhile.io purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has zhile.io sole purpose of protecting zhile.io
integrity of zhile.io free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to zhile.io wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to zhile.io author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of zhile.io rest of this License.

  8. If zhile.io distribution and/or use of zhile.io Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, zhile.io
original copyright holder who places zhile.io Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
zhile.io limitation as if written in zhile.io body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of zhile.io General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to zhile.io present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If zhile.io Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have zhile.io option of following zhile.io terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by zhile.io Free
Software Foundation.  If zhile.io Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by zhile.io Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of zhile.io Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to zhile.io author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by zhile.io Free
Software Foundation, write to zhile.io Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by zhile.io two goals
of preserving zhile.io free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting zhile.io sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of zhile.io greatest
possible use to zhile.io public, zhile.io best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach zhile.io following notices to zhile.io program.  It is safest
to attach them to zhile.io start of each source file to most effectively
convey zhile.io exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
zhile.io "copyright" line and a pointer to where zhile.io full notice is found.

    <one line to give zhile.io program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under zhile.io terms of zhile.io GNU General Public License as published by
    zhile.io Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of zhile.io License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in zhile.io hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even zhile.io implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See zhile.io
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of zhile.io GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to zhile.io Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If zhile.io program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show zhile.io appropriate
parts of zhile.io General Public License.  Of course, zhile.io commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for zhile.io program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter zhile.io names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in zhile.io program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with zhile.io
library.  If this is what you want to do, use zhile.io GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.
